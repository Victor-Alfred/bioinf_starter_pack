A collection of resources and papers for absolute beginners
===========================================================

The goal of this list is to provide a bunch of resources for people working in
the wet-lab, but interested in learning some basic scripting, data cleaning and
analysis to be more efficient. Suggestions and comments are welcome.

Papers with basic info
----------------------

* So you want to be a computational biologist?
  [10.1038/nbt.2740](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt.2740)
* A quick guide for developing effective bioinformatics programming skills
  [10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000589](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000589)
* A quick guide to organizing computational biology projects
  [10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424)

Work a bit more efficiently and reproducibly
--------------------------------------------

It might seem to much to demand reproducibility, version control and similar
stuff from an absolute beginners, but better start early. If you keep a lab
notebook, you should keep something similar, when writing ugly hacks. Probably
the information is quite redundant in the following papers, but just to make
sure.

* Five selfish reasons to work reproducibly
  [10.1186/s13059-015-0850-7](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-015-0850-7)

* Tidy Data [10.18637/jss.v059.i10](http://dx.doi.org/10.18637/jss.v059.i10)
* Best Practices for Scientific Computing
