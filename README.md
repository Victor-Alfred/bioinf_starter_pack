# A collection of resources and papers for absolute beginners

The goal of this list is to provide a bunch of resources for people working in
the wet-lab, but interested in learning basic scripting, data cleaning and
analysis to be more efficient. Suggestions and comments are welcome.

## Papers with basic info

Papers with the very basics. What is computational biology, how to pick up
skills, why computational biology is important at all and a research field in
its own right.

* [So you want to be a computational biologist?](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.2740)
* [A quick guide for developing effective bioinformatics programming skills](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000589)
* [A quick guide to organizing computational biology projects](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424)
* [Computational biologists: moving to the driver's seat](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-017-1357-1)
* [All biology is computational biology](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2002050)

## Papers on reproducibility, version control and coding

It might seem too much to demand reproducibility, version control and similar
stuff from the very start, but better start early. If you keep a lab
notebook, you should keep something similar when writing ~~ugly hacks~~
elaborate analysis pipelines.

* [A statistical definition for reproducibility and replicability](https://doi.org/10.1101/066803)
* [Five selfish reasons to work reproducibly](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-015-0850-7)
* [A Quick Introduction to Version Control with Git and GitHub](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668)
* [Ten Simple Rules for Taking Advantage of git and GitHub](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947)
* [Tidy Data](https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v059.i10)
* [Best Practices for Scientific Computing](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745)
* [Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00037)
* [Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Computational Research](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285)

## Perspective

* [Biological data sciences in genome research](https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.191684.115)

## Primer collections

* Nature Biotechnology and PLoS Computational Biology Primers collected
  [here](http://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/~hoogeboomhj/mcb/nature_primer.html)
* Data visualization: A view of every Points of View column
  [here](http://blogs.nature.com/methagora/2013/07/data-visualization-points-of-view.html)
* Points of Significance: Statistics for Biologists
  [here](http://www.nature.com/collections/qghhqm/pointsofsignificance)

## Stuff to install

* Install some kind of Linux distribution. [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) is a good start.
* Install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).
* Install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a Python distribution.
* Check [bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io) and install some bioinformatics packages.
* Check [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/install) and install some R packages.

## Markdown

Take a look at [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), a
light-weight markup language to easily format text files, and convert them to
other formats. github and other sites render it nicely.

## Data organization

* Data Carpentry - [Data Organization in Spreadsheets for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/)

## Linux command line

* The Command Line Crash [Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book)
